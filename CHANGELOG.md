# Changelog

## 💬 1.7.0

- ### Features

  - **Add progress bar during Site upload - [gabbifish], [issue/906] [pull/956]**

    Larger static asset uploads in Wrangler now show a progress bar based on the bulk uploads being made.

  - **Allow custom webpack config for Workers Sites projects - [ashleymichal], [issue/905] [pull/957]**

    Previously we blocked users from declaring `webpack_config` in their `wrangler.toml`, as it can be relatively confusing due to the nested nature of the workers-site directory. We removed that block, and added a friendly help message when webpack build fails and the user has a custom `webpack_config` declared.

  - **Reformat config api-key output - [bradyjoslin], [issue/889] [pull/910]**

    We care a lot about our error output. Now the output from `wrangler config` is consistent between calls with and without the `--api-key` flag.

  - **Improve error message for `wrangler init --site` when wrangler.toml already exists - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/648] [pull/931]**

    `wrangler init` generally expects that you don't already have a `wrangler.toml` present; however it is common that users want to add static site functionality to their existing wrangler project and will try using `wrangler init` to do so. Rather than simply complaining that the toml already exists, now we add the `workers-site` directory to the project, and print out the suggested configuration to add to `wrangler.toml`. Much nicer!

  - **Add a helpful error message on authentication error - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/492] [pull/932]**

    Previously, when `wrangler publish` ran into authentication errors, the API result would just print to the screen. Now, it prints a helpful hint to users to re-run `wrangler config` to fix the error.

  - **Provide helpful error when user accidentally puts kv-namespace config under `[site]` - [gabbifish], [issue/798] [pull/937]**

    TOML formatting can be tricky, specifically tables, so it is common for users unfamiliar with the format to accidentally nest attributes inside tables without intending it. In this case, if a user adds a kv-namespaces entry to the bottom of a toml with [site] configuration already declared, it is parsed as a part of the [site] table, rather than as a top-level key. The error output from this is not super helpful, as it just says "unknown field `kv-namespaces`" which isn't precisely correct.

    This PR detects when this error occurs and provides a help suggestion to put kv-namespaces ABOVE the [site] table entry to fix the problem.

- ### Fixes

  - **Don't install `wasm-pack` for `webpack` type projects - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/745] [pull/849]**

    You may have noticed that Wrangler installs `wasm-pack` for your `webpack` projects, which may seem strange since it's the tool we use to build Rust projects. The reason for this is because you can _also_ build Rust using `wasm-pack` and `webpack` in tandem if you use the [`wasm-pack-plugin`](https://github.com/wasm-tool/wasm-pack-plugin). This plugin recently added support for handling the installation of `wasm-pack` which means Wrangler no longer needs to handle those installs.

  - **Make Azure use latest `rustc` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/887] [pull/893]**

    Updates our CI to update the rust toolchain to the latest stable version after installation.

  - **Fix compiler warnings on windows - [uma0317], [issue/800] [pull/919]**

    We build Wrangler for Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows, and each of these environments has slightly different needs at compile time. In this case, community contributor [uma0317] added configuration that eliminated unused imports for Windows at compile time.

  - **Remove deprecated kv-namespace config check - [ashleymichal], [pull/929]**

    Back in 1.1.0, we introduced more robust support for adding KV namespaces to your project. It was a breaking change for users who were still using our first pass at configuration for this in their toml, so we added a friendly error message telling them how to update their `wrangler.toml`. At this point, all of our users have safely transitioned onto the new syntax, and so we removed the warning; any lingering use of the old syntax will be met with a parse error instead.

    [pull/929]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/929

  - **Use binary-install for npm - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/862]**

    This extracts a lot of the logic in Wrangler's installer to an external package, [binary-install], which we will also use for installing wasm-pack on webpack project builds. Switching to this package also has the added benefit of cleaning up the downloaded binary on `npm uninstall -g @cloudflare/wrangler`.

## 🎰 1.6.0

- ### Features

  - **_BREAKING CHANGE_: Require the `webpack_config` field in `wrangler.toml` to build with a custom configuration - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/296] [pull/847]**

    Wrangler will no longer use a `webpack.config.js` at the root of your project to build your worker. If you would like to continue using a custom build configuration, you will need to specify the `webpack_config` field in your `wrangler.toml` like so:

    ```toml
    name = "my-worker"
    workers_dev = true
    account_id = "01234567890987654321234567890"
    webpack_config = "webpack.config.js"
    ```

  - **API Token Support - [gabbifish]/[ashleymichal], [issue/354] [pull/471]/[pull/879]**

    Wrangler can now be configured with API Tokens!

    Don't worry, current configurations with an email address and a Global API Key will continue to work, but we highly recommend that you switch to API Tokens as they are a much more secure authentication method.

    If you want to use API tokens, create an API token from the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" API token template [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens), and copy/paste it in the `wrangler config` prompt. Alternatively, you can set the `CF_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

  - **Check for valid credentials when running `wrangler config` - [gabbifish], [issue/439] [pull/842]**

    Before this version of Wrangler, `wrangler config` would allow any input string to be passed for your user details. Now, Wrangler validates that the credentials will work with Cloudflare's API.

  - **Add a warning when publishing a Workers Site to a route without a trailing asterisk - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/814] [pull/839]**

    When publishing a Workers Site to your own domain, it's important that the Worker code runs on every path on your domain. This isn't particularly clear, so now when attempting to publish a Workers Site to a route without a trailing asterisk, Wrangler will print a warning message.

  - **Remove --version on subcommands - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/791] [pull/829]**

    Each subcommand in Wrangler used to take a `--version` argument which would print the name of the subcommand. For instance, `wrangler publish --version` would print `wrangler-publish`. This wasn't super helpful, so we've removed that functionality.

  - **Create fixtures programatically - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/854]**

    Wrangler's test suite relied on a large number of fixtures that it read in from the file system. Now, it writes the test fixtures itself and does not rely on reading fixtures from the file system.

## 👻 1.5.0

- ### Features

  - **Deprecate `wrangler publish --release` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/538] [pull/751]**

    `wrangler publish --release` is now simply an alias of `wrangler publish`. This is related to the introduction of [environments](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/blob/master/docs/content/environments.md) made in [1.3.1](#-131) and is intended to reduce confusion surrounding deploy targets. Previously, `wrangler publish --release` would deploy to a route on your own domain, and `wrangler publish` would deploy to your workers.dev subdomain. This was a confusing API, and we now require individual environments to have either `workers_dev = true` **or** both a `route` and `zone_id` in each section of `wrangler.toml`. This makes it very clear where your Workers code is being deployed. If you're not using `wrangler publish --release` but you added `workers_dev = false` to the top level of your `wrangler.toml` because Wrangler warned you to - you can now safely remove it! If you **are** using `wrangler publish --release`, know that it is functionally the same as `wrangler publish`. If you want to deploy to workers.dev and also a route on your own domain, you will need to set up multiple environments.

  - **Deprecate `private` field in `wrangler.toml` - [stevenfranks], [issue/782] [pull/782]**

    In a related note, the `private` field no longer functions in `wrangler.toml`. The original intent behind this field was to allow "publishing" without "activating". Unfortunately this led to a lot of undefined behavior if the value was switched from `true` to `false` in between a `wrangler publish` command and a `wrangler publish --release` command and vice versa. With the removal of `wrangler publish --release`, we are also removing the `private` field. If your `wrangler.toml` files contain a value for private, you can remove it!

  - **Include/exclude static assets in a Workers Sites project - [gabbifish], [issue/716] [pull/760]**

    Your `wrangler.toml` has two new optional fields: `include` and `exclude`. These fields give you more granular control over what files are uploaded to Workers KV. This behavior mirrors Cargo's [include/exclude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-exclude-and-include-fields-optional) functionality. Further documentation for this feature is available [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/ignore-assets/).

  - **A more robust `wrangler generate` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/315] [pull/759]**

    `wrangler generate` is now much smarter about `wrangler.toml` files. Previously, `wrangler generate` would simply create the same configuration for every project, and it would ignore any `wrangler.toml` that was committed to the template. This means much less guesswork when using `wrangler generate` with existing Workers projects.

- ### Fixes

  - **Fix Rust live preview - [gabbifish], [issue/618] [pull/699]**

    If you use Wrangler to develop Rust Workers, you may have noticed that live preview (`wrangler preview --watch`) was not working with your project. Not to worry though, we cracked down on this bug with an (oxidized) iron fist! Wrangler now has cross-platform support for live previewing Rust Workers.

  - **Minimize timeout errors for bulk uploads - [gabbifish], [issue/746] [pull/757]**

    Sometimes Wrangler would make API calls to Workers KV that would timeout if there were too many files. We've increased the amount of time Wrangler will wait around for the API operations to complete.

    [pull/757]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/757

  - **Print readable error message when external commands fail - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/799]**

    Wrangler depends on a few external applications, and sometimes the calls to them fail! When this happens, Wrangler would tell you the command it tried to run, but it included a bunch of quotes. This change removes those quotes so the command is easily readable and can be copy/pasted.

    [pull/799]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/799

  - **Disallow `wrangler generate --site` with a template argument - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/776] [pull/789]**

    In Wrangler 1.4.0, we introduced [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/), which included the ability to run `wrangler generate --site` which would use our site template behind the scenes. Confusingly, you could also pass a template to this command: `wrangler generate my-site https://github.com/example/worker-site --site`, which would not behave as expected. This specific usage will now correctly output an error.

- ### Maintenance

  - **Begin refactoring test suite - [ashleymichal], [pull/787]**

    We're constantly shipping features in Wrangler, and with more features comes a larger codebase. As a codebase expands, it goes through some growing pains. This release includes some improvements to the internal organization of Wrangler's codebase, and is intended to make our lives and our contributors' lives easier moving forward.

    - Moved all "fixture" helper functions to "utils" module to share between build/preview tests

    - Removed "metadata_wasm.json" from `simple_rust` fixture

    - Extracted all module declrations in `main.rs` to `lib.rs` to allow tests to import with `use wrangler::foo`

## 🎂 1.4.0

- ### Features

  - **Workers Sites - [pull/509]**

    Wrangler 1.4.0 includes supports for **Workers Sites**, enabling developers to deploy static applications directly to Workers. Workers Sites is perfect for frontend frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), as well as static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Gatsby](https://gohugo.io/).

    Workers Sites is a feature exclusive to Wrangler, and combines a great developer experience with excellent performance. The `--site` flag has been added to `wrangler init` and `wrangler generate` to use Workers Sites with new and existing projects:

    ```sh
    # Add Workers Sites to an existing project
    $ wrangler init --site

    # Start a new Workers Sites project
    $ wrangler generate --site
    ```

    If you're ready to get started using Workers Sites, we've written guides for the various routes you might take with your project:

    - [Create a new project from scratch](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/start-from-scratch)
    - [Deploy a pre-existing static site project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/start-from-existing)
    - [Add static assets to a pre-existing Workers project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/start-from-worker)

    For more details on how Workers Sites works with Wrangler, check out [the documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/reference). We also have a brand new [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials/deploy-a-react-app) to help you learn the Workers Sites workflow, by deploying a React application!

    Workers Sites has been a heroic effort by the entire Workers Developer Experience team, comprising of Wrangler updates, new [project templates](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template), and [open-source packages](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler). We're super excited about the future that Workers Sites represents, where static sites and serverless functions can work together to build powerful, cutting-edge applications. 

    Make sure to try out Workers Sites to build your next app! 🎉🎉🎉

- ### Fixes

  **Ensure we install and cache the latest version of cargo-generate and wasm-pack if user has an outdated cargo installed version - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/666] [pull/726]**

    Wrangler orchestrates a few other tools under the hood, notably [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) and [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate). We use a library called [`binary-install`](https://github.com/rustwasm/binary-install) to fetch and cache binaries we download. However, to avoid downloading unecessarily, we first check if the user has a copy locally on their machine that they had `cargo install`'d. We had a bug where in this logic branch, we *didn't* check that the local version was the most up-to-date version. This meant that users who had an older installed version may run into errors when wrangler expected to use features of a newer version of that tool. This PR adds the logic to check for the version and will install and cache a newer version for wrangler to use (leaving your local version as is!).

- ### Documentation

  - **Webpack documentation - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/721] [pull/724]**

    For our default build type, aptly named "webpack", Wrangler uses webpack under the hood to bundle all of your assets.

## 🐛 1.3.1

- ### Features

  - **Environments - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/385][pull/386]**

    Wrangler 1.3.1 includes supports for **environments**, allowing developers to deploy Workers projects to multiple places. For instance, an application can be deployed to a production URL _and_ a staging URL, without having to juggle multiple configuration files.

    To use environments, you can now pass in `[env.$env_name]` properties in your `wrangler.toml`. Here's an example:

    ```toml
    type = "webpack"
    name = "my-worker-dev"
    account_id = "12345678901234567890"
    zone_id = "09876543210987654321"
    workers_dev = false

    [env.staging]
    name = "my-worker-staging"
    route = "staging.example.com/*"

    [env.production]
    name = "my-worker"
    route = "example.com/*"
    ```

    With multiple environments defined, `wrangler build`, `wrangler preview`, and `wrangler publish` now accept a `--env` flag to indicate what environment you'd like to use, for instance, `wrangler publish --env production`.

    To support developers transitioning to environments, we've written documentation for the feature, including further information about deprecations and advanced usage. [Check out the documentation here!](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/blob/master/docs/content/environments.md)

  - **KV commands - [ashleymichal], [gabbifish], [issue/339][pull/405]**

    Wrangler 1.3.1 includes commands for managing and updating [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/) namespaces, keys, and values directly from the CLI.

    - `wrangler kv:namespace`

      `wrangler kv:namespace` allows developers to `create`, `list`, and `delete` KV namespaces, from the CLI. This allows Wrangler users to configure new namespaces without having to navigate into the Cloudflare Web UI to manage namespaces. Once a namespace has been created, Wrangler will even give you the exact configuration to copy into your `wrangler.toml` to begin using your new namespace in your project. Neat!

      ```console
      $ wrangler kv:namespace create "MY_KV"
      🌀  Creating namespace with title "worker-MY_KV"
      ✨  Success: WorkersKvNamespace {
        id: "e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8",
        title: "worker-MY_KV",
      }
      ✨  Add the following to your wrangler.toml:
      kv-namespaces = [
        { binding = "MY_KV", id = "e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8" }
      ]
      ```

    - `wrangler kv:key`

      `wrangler kv:key` gives CLI users access to reading, listing, and updating KV keys inside of a namespace. For instance, given a namespace with the binding `KV`, you can directly set keys and values from the CLI, including passing expiration data, such as below:

      ```console
      $ wrangler kv:key put --binding=KV "key" "value" --ttl=10000
      ✨  Success
      ```

    - `wrangler kv:bulk`

      `wrangler kv:bulk` can be used to quickly upload or remove a large number of values from Workers KV, by accepting a JSON file containing KV data. Let's define a JSON file, `data.json`:

      ```json
      [
        {
          "key": "test_key",
          "value": "test_value",
          "expiration_ttl": 3600
        },
        {
          "key": "test_key2",
          "value": "test_value2",
          "expiration_ttl": 3600
        }
      ]
      ```

      By calling `wrangler kv:bulk put --binding=KV data.json`, I can quickly create two new keys in Workers KV - `test_key` and `test_key2`, with the corresponding values `test_value` and `test_value2`:

      ```console
      $ wrangler kv:bulk put --binding=KV data.json
      ✨  Success
      ```

    The KV subcommands in Wrangler 1.3.1 make it super easy to comfortably query and manage your Workers KV data without ever having to leave the command-line. For more information on the available commands and their usage, see [the documentation](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/blob/master/docs/content/kv_commands.md). 🤯

## 💆🏻‍♂️ 1.2.0

- ### Features

  - **Implement live previewing for wrangler - [xortive], [pull/451]**

    The `wrangler preview` command now supports live previewing! As you develop your project, you can start up a link between your local codebase and the preview service by running `wrangler preview --watch`. Any updates to your project will be passed to the preview service, allowing you to instantly see any changes to your project. This is a _massive_ improvement to the development process for building applications with Workers, and we're super excited to ship it!

    A huge shout-out to @xortive, who almost single-handedly built this feature during his summer internship at Cloudflare, over the last few months. Amazing work! 😍

## 🏄‍♀️ 1.1.1

- ### Features

  - **Install current version, not latest - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/418][pull/419]**

    Previously the NPM installer for wrangler would always pull the most recent release from Github releases, and the installer did not increase version numbers when Wrangler did. Many users found this confusing. Now the installer will increment versions along with Wrangler releases, and point at specific versions rather than the most recent one at the time of installation.

  - **Improve JSON errors debuggability - [xtuc], [pull/394]**

    This PR improves JSON error output in `wrangler`. Specifically:

    - If a `package.json` file fails to decode, `wrangler` now emits a clearer error:

      ```
      $ wrangler build
      ⬇️  Installing wranglerjs...
      ⬇️  Installing wasm-pack...
      thread 'main' panicked at 'could not parse "./package.json": Error("expected `,` or `}`", line: 4, column: 3)', src/libcore/result.rs:999:5
      ```

    - If the `wranglerjs` backend returns invalid JSON, it now preserves the output file for further investigation. Note that the console doesn't print the output file location by default, and you will need to pass `RUST_LOG=info` while running `wrangler build`, and search for the `--output-file=FILE` argument passed to `wranglerjs`:

      ```
      $ RUST_LOG=info wrangler build
      ⬇️ Installing wasm-pack...
      [2019-08-09T19:28:48Z INFO  wrangler::commands::build::wranglerjs] Running "/Users/kristian/.nvm/versions/node/v12.1.0/bin/node" "/Users/kristian/src/workers/wrangler/wranglerjs" "--output-file=/var/folders/5x/yzqyqst11n518yl8xl7yv1f80000gp/T/.wranglerjs_output5eREv" # ...
      ```

    - If the preview service returns invalid JSON, it now emits a clearer error, and the full output can be seen by using `RUST_LOG=info`.

      Previously:

      ```
      $ wrangler preview

- ### Fixes

  - **Fix `wrangler config` for systems with non-unix EOL - [xortive], [issue/389][pull/399]**

    `wrangler config` was not properly truncating whitespace from the end of user input, resulting in a panic when trying to use `wrangler publish`, because `wrangler` would try to create an HTTP header with invalid characters. Now, `wrangler` will properly truncate extra whitespace (including `\r`) from the end of the input into `wrangler config`.

  - **Migrate straggler emojis to terminal::emoji - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/382]**

    This PR updates the last remaining instances where `wrangler` was using hard-coded emojis for messages, rather than using `terminal::emoji`. In addition, there are two instances where this PR changes the usage of the ⛔ emoji to ⚠️.

## 🔑 1.1.0

Wrangler 1.1.0 includes a number of improvements to documentation and project stability, including:

- ### Security

  - **Change global config perm - [xtuc], [pull/286]**

    This PR improves the security of Wrangler's global config file, by restricting access to Wrangler's global user configuration file (`~/.wrangler/config/default.toml`) to the user who ran the wrangler config command. **For existing Wrangler users, please run `wrangler config` again on your machine!** This will fix the permissions of your global config file to be scoped to your user account.

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [pull/286]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/286#event-2516759398

  - **Use stdin instead of arguments for wrangler config - [xtuc], [pull/329]**

    We've made the `wrangler config` command interactive – the previous version of the command, `wrangler config $email $apiKey`, would be captured by your terminal's history, often exposing that information in a `~/.bash_history` or a similar file. The new version of `wrangler config` will prompt you for your `email` and `api_key` via `stdin`.

    In addition, this PR also adds support for a `WRANGLER_HOME` environment variable, which will be the location for Wrangler's "home" directory, if you need to customize where Wrangler saves its configuration information.

* ### Features

  - **Support KV Namespace Configuration - [ashleymichal], [pull/334], add check + error message for pre 1.1.0 kv namespace format - [xortive], [pull/369]**

    Wrangler now supports using [Workers KV][kv] namespaces in your project! To start using KV with your projects, create a namespace in the Cloduflare Dashboard, and the namespace information to your `wrangler.toml` configuration file. The `kv-namespaces` key requires setting a `binding` (the representation of your namespace in your code) and `id`, the namespace ID:

    ```toml
    # wrangler.toml

    [[kv-namespaces]]
    binding = "TODOS"
    id = "0f2ac74b498b48028cb68387c421e279"
    ```

    **If you were previously using the undocumented `kv-namespaces` support in your project config, you'll need to make a few changes to your project to use Wrangler 1.1.0!** KV namespaces now need to be created manually, in the Cloudflare Dashboard, to be able to use them in your Wrangler configuration - previous versions of Wrangler created the namespace for you, but the process is now manual, to allow developers to be more explicit about how their KV namespaces are created.

    For users of the previously undocumented `kv-namespaces` functionality in Wrangler, we've provided a warning and upgrade path, to help you upgrade your KV configuration in your project to the correct format:

    ```
    ⚠️  As of 1.1.0 the kv-namespaces format has been stabilized ⚠️
    💁‍  Please add a section like this in your `wrangler.toml` for each KV Namespace you wish to bind: 💁‍

    [[kv-namespaces]]
    binding = "BINDING_NAME"
    id = "0f2ac74b498b48028cb68387c421e279"

    # binding is the variable name you wish to bind the namespace to in your script.
    # id is the namespace_id assigned to your kv namespace upon creation. e.g. (per namespace)

    Error: ⚠️  Your project config has an error ⚠️
    ```

  - **Configure Workers KV in your wrangler.toml - [ashleymichal], [pull/333]**

    If you've tried to use [Workers KV][kv] in Wrangler, you've probably had a bad time! This PR, along with [#334](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/334), build support for handling and correctly uploading KV namespace information with your Wrangler project:

    ```
    [[kv-namespaces]]
    binding = "NAMESPACE"
    id = "0f2ac74b498b48028cb68387c421e279"

  - **Use ENV variables to configure Wrangler - [AaronO], [pull/225]**

    Previously, Wrangler required a global configuration file to be able to run. As many users may use Wrangler in situations where they don't have an interactive terminal, meaning they can't instantiate a config file using `wrangler config`, this PR allows Wrangler to run even if the config file doesn't exist. This change means that users can also configure Wrangler exclusively with environment variables, using `$CF_API_KEY` for your Cloudflare API key, and `$CF_EMAIL` for your Cloudflare account email.

  - **Adds more descriptive subdomain errors - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/207][pull/259]**

    It's super easy to grab a workers.dev subdomain using the `subdomain` command in `wrangler` – so easy, in fact, that many people were trying to use it without even having a Cloudflare account! `wrangler` now warns users when they attempt to add a subdomain without configuring their `account_id` in `wrangler.toml`, as well as when you've already registered a subdomain, or if the subdomain you're trying to register has already been claimed.

  - **Allow custom webpack configuration in wrangler.toml - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/246][pull/253]**

    If you'd like to bring your own Webpack config to your Workers project, you can now specify a `webpack_config` key in `wrangler.toml`:

    ```toml
    webpack_config: webpack.prod.js
    ```

  - **Display commands in their defined order - [Electroid], [pull/236]**

    We've re-arranged the order of the commands when you run `wrangler` without any subcommands, so that commonly-used commands are easier to find!

    [electroid]: https://github.com/Electroid
    [pull/233]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/236

  - **Show project size on build - [xtuc], [pull/205]**

    Once the build is finished, `wrangler` now prints the compressed size of the script, and, if available, the Wasm binary size:

    ```
    $ wrangler publish
    ⬇️ Installing wranglerjs...
    ⬇️ Installing wasm-pack...
    ✨   Built successfully, built project size is 517 bytes. ✨
    ```

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [pull/205]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/205

  - **Add HTTP prefix to publish command output. - [elithrar], [pull/198]**

    Prefix "https://" in front of the "script available" output to allow shells to automatically detect it as a link. Many shells will allow you to click directly on the URL from inside the terminal (such as iTerm's "CMD-Click"), making it much easier to navigate to your subdomains, or any published Workers applications.

    [elithrar]: https://github.com/elithrar
    [pull/198]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/198

  - **Build: add message and emoji - [xtuc], [pull/193]**

    The `wrangler` team _really_ loves emoji, so we made sure to send a little bit of ✨ cheer ✨ your way, via a new message and emoji, whenever you use the `build` subcommand. 💌

- ### 🤕 Fixes

  - **Remove OpenSSL installation step from README - [xortive], [issue/355][pull/356]**

    Due to an OpenSSL dependency in [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/), Wrangler required developers to install OpenSSL as part of the setup process for using Wrangler. [Version 0.3.1](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/pull/170) of `cargo-generate` has removed this requirement, and you no longer need to install OpenSSL manually to use Wrangler. Hooray!

    [pull/356]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/356

  - **Fix issue previewing a project with KV namespaces - [ashleymichal], [pull/353]**

    This PR fixes a critical bug where using `wrangler preview` on a project with [Workers KV][kv] namespaces causes the command to throw an error.

    [ashleymichal]: https://github.com/ashleymichal
    [pull/353]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/353

  - **Enforce one Webpack entry in configuration - [xtuc], [pull/245]**

    `wrangler` now returns an error during the build process if you use a webpack configuration with more than one export – `wrangler` needs to have a single known export from webpack to know what to build!

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [pull/245]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/245

  - **Update default template for Rust project type - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/309]**

    Previously, when passing `--type rust` to `wrangler generate`, the only indication that it worked was that the type in `wrangler.toml` was `rust`. There were no Rust files in the default template, for a Rust-type project. Now, when running `wrangler generate --type rust`, `wrangler` will use [rustwasm-worker-template](https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template) when generating a new project.

    [pull/309]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/309

  - **Stop cleaning webpack build artifacts - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/307]**

    The configuration for Webpack projects in Wrangler was over-eager to clean build artifacts, which in the worst-case, caused Wrangler to remove source code for developers' projects - oops! This fix relaxes the Webpack cleaning process, to ensure that building a Wrangler project is a bit safer.

    [pull/307]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/307

  - **Correct binding format - [xtuc], [pull/260]**

    Previously, `wrangler` was incorrectly sending up a `binding` object to the Cloudflare API, whenever we attempted to update a script's bindings. This fix renames it to `bindings`, and uses an array, as per the Cloudflare API requirements.

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [pull/260]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/260

  - **Correctly pass Wasm module - [xtuc], [pull/261]**

    To ensure that a wasm module is successfully passed between `wranglerjs` and `wrangler`, the wasm module is now encoded and decoded from base64, avoiding any potential loss of data.

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [pull/261]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/261

  - **Check for `account_id` and `zone_id` before publishing - [xtuc], [issue/170][pull/192]**

    The `publish` subcommand in `wrangler` now ensures that you have an `account_id` and `zone_id` configured in your `wrangler.toml` file before attempting to publish, instead of failing during the publishing process.

    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc
    [issue/170]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/issues/170
    [pull/192]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/192

  - **Fix Rust ref issue with `wranglerjs` builds - [xtuc], [pull/227]**

    When `wranglerjs` built a project, it incorrectly referred to the output of that build process without using a Rust reference - this PR fixes that issue and allows `wranglerjs` to correctly take your bundle, and your project's metadata, and put it all together in a nice little package to send up to the Cloudflare API. Hooray, working projects!

* ### 🔧 Maintenance

  - **Better error printing - [xortive], [pull/327]**

  - **Always use multipart upload - [ashleymichal], [issue/280][pull/328]**

    We've updated how Wrangler uploads projects to the Workers runtime - as Wrangler supports the entire Workers ecosystem (including tools like [Workers KV][kv], the publishing process should use [multipart forms](https://dev.to/sidthesloth92/understanding-html-form-encoding-url-encoded-and-multipart-forms-3lpa) to allow uploading all of the data that represents a Workers project in a single step.

    [pull/328]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/328

  - **unify upload form building - [ashleymichal], [pull/329]**

    This PR brings consistency to the way that metadata is handled during Wrangler's `preview` and `build` commands: previously, a `metadata.json` file handled the bindings for your Wrangler project, but because it was handled differently for various project types (such as `webpack` or `rust`), it led to inconsistent behavior during the upload process. This PR removes usage of `metadata.json` in favor of building metadata for each project type in-memory, which will then be uploaded directly to Workers platform. This work is foundational for improved Workers KV support in Wrangler 🙌

    [pull/329]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/329

  - **`wrangler preview` integration tests - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/363]**

    [pull/363]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/363

  - **Add user agent - [xtuc], [issue/234][pull/236]**

    For every outgoing request, `wrangler` includes a `User-Agent` header to clearly indicate to servers and APIs that a `wrangler` client is making a request: `wrangler/dev` in debug mode and `wrangler/$version` in release mode.

  - **Terminal messaging abstraction - [ashleymical], [issue/219][pull/263]**

    We've made improvements to Wrangler's terminal output functionality, with support for various log levels and implementations in Wrangler's API for easily using the log levels in future development.

    The new terminal output functionality can be used by importing the `terminal::message` crate:

    ```rust
    use crate::terminal::message;

    message::info("Building project") // "💁‍ Building project"
    message::success("Your project has been deployed!") // "✨ Your project has been deployed!"

    // Other available functions:
    // message::warn, message::user_error, message::working, message::preview

  - **Remove pre-push hooks - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/308]**

    Previous versions of Wrangler included pre-push hooks to ensure that code was linted before being pushed up to Git. This hook made it difficult to manage in-progress work, so the hooks have been removed.

    [pull/308]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/308

  - **Use serde for metadata - [xtuc], [pull/285]**

    This change adds proper construction of the worker metadata, previously, it was an error-prone string.

    [pull/285]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/pull/285

  - **Refactor: Conditional per command in main - [ashleymical], [pull/279]**

    The `src/main.rs` file in Wrangler has been rewritten so that the layout of the file is easier to read.

  - **Fix `publish` and `preview` bug for projects with a `-` - [jaysonsantos], [issue/36][pull/38]**

    Rust is a sometimes surprisingly opinionated language! When your `Cargo.toml` specifies a project
    name with a hyphen(`-`) in the name, the Rust compiler will implicitly understand this as a `_` for
    all imports and when it creates compiled artifacts it will name them with a `_`.

    The original implementation of `wrangler` skipped over this, and as a result would go looking for a
    wasm file with a `-` when it should have been looking for a `_`. This resulted in a bit of a gross
    error message that stated that a file was not found.

    We've fixed this now- so go ahead and name your packages with `-`s!

  - **Install instructions with OpenSSL troubleshooting notes - [AustinCorridor], [issue/35][pull/43]**

    Because of `wrangler`'s use of `cargo-generate` we use OpenSSL. Classically, this is a tricky
    dependency. Some users may run into issue with it! We've documented the steps to fix it on MacOS-
    if you run into this on other platforms, we'd love a PR!
